# CLINIC-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Clinic Management System is about giving doctor’s appointment to the patients. In the process of giving appointments, basic details of the patient like name, age, gender and phone number are noted. Patients will also be asked about the doctor (specialist) they want to meet. For example, the doctor can be a Cardiologist, Gynaecologist, Neurologist, etc.; When finally all the details are noted, he’ll be asked to pay the fee and then he’ll be given a token number. And after that he’ll be added into the waiting list. There is also special appointment available here, where the patient will be charged extra and is placed in the first position of the waiting list exceeding the others. This list is created using the data structure-'Singly Linked List'. Finally, the patient on the top of the list will be called out by displaying his token no., name and the specialist on the screen available for patients.
